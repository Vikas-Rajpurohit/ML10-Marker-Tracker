# ML10-Marker-Tracker
Path Tracing Visualizer üìä‚úèÔ∏è: Unveil Motion Trajectories! This Python project leverages OpenCV and ArUco markers to meticulously trace and visualize 2D and 3D points, offering a captivating display of the journey taken by the marker through intricate plots and dynamic graphs.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of marker motion using OpenCV and ArUco markers.
- Visualization of marker trajectories in 2D and 3D.
- Dynamic text display indicating left/right, up/down, and forward/backward directions.
- Customizable arrow visualization for direction changes.
- Color-coded markers to indicate Z values in the 3D plot.

## Run the Python Script to start capturing frames from Webcam: 

1. A window will open, displaying the real-time camera feed with marker tracking.
2. Track Marker Motion:
 - Press the 'Start' button to initiate marker motion tracking.
 - Move the marker within the camera's view to see real-time tracking.
 - Observe dynamic text indicators for left/right, up/down, and forward/backward directions.
 - Press 'Stop' to end tracking.
3. Visualize the Trajectory:
 - After stopping, a plotted trajectory of the marker's path will be displayed.
4. Explore plotted 2D and 3D trajectories.
